Frontend for yt-dl using a functional progress bar that moves as the download progresses.

How to use:

* Save the script
* Make it executable
* Run the script

The progress bar will fill as the video downloads, showing the current percentage.  Upon finishing, a dialog box will confirm the files are saved in ~/Downloads.
